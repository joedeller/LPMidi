# LPMidi
Python interface to Novation Launchpads for the Novation Pop Up Shop Workshop sessions

Inspired by the work found at https://github.com/FMMT666/launchpad.py
Re-written to use rtmidi instead of pygame, different bit twiddling for scrolling
This library supports a very limited set of Launchpad devices.
